# dsign-responsive
v.2

Used assets from a design concept to practice SASS, mobile first responsive design and HTML content generation using AJAX.

In the 'templates' folder I have included the images of the website layout as it was given to me. Following these templates I created a responsive version of the website.

If you are interested in the first version of this project, check out 'dsign-portfolio' in my repository.

The website was never finished as the layout has completely changed over time, but these assets served me with a sandbox to try and practice new concepts.
