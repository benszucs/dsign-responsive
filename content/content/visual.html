        <div class="mb-2">THE BOOK “VISUAL SYSTEMS” IS FILLED WITH COLLABORATIVE WORK IN SMALL TEAMS OF PEOPLE UNDERGOING DIFFERENT TASKS EACH TIME IN VERY SHORT TIME FRAMES. THE BOOK IS MADE UP OF FIVE ASSIGNMENTS OVERALL SOME BROAD BRIEFS AIMED AT MAKING CHANGE AND SOME FOCUSED AUDIENCE BRIEFS.</div>
        <div>THE 130 PAGE BOOK IS FILLED WITH FOCUSED DESIGN AS WELL AS A BROAD RESEARCH ON EACH PROJECT DONE BY MYSELF AND THE TEAMS I WORKED WITH.</div>

        <div class="text">The Mood Room is a conceptual space for students to go and study, or relax. For this room we developed a series of colours fading between each other, this was done in the order that resembles the mood of the campus throughout the day; Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, these findings were researched and recorded according to what students felt like from morning to evening.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="col2">
        <div class="text">This concept was set up on a projector aimed at a set of white chairs next to white walls. We chose everything to be white so it reflects the colours a lot better and soaks it up. It represents a space, a room where students can go at any time of the day and the colour tint in the room match the time of day, so it fits well with what mood you are most likely to be feeling.</div>

        <div class="text">The Godiva Gift Finder App is the outcome of a brief we did working in collaboration with Thinking Juice, a growing design agency based in Bournemouth. For this I made a functioning app mock up, so in the presentation I could walk through what the concept is clearly.</div>

      <div class="col2">
        <div class="text">This was a client oriented brief so the entire time I was making sure that the design fits in with the current branding, Godiva is a well known chocolate brand, with a recognisable identity, which needs to be retained like any other live brand oriented brief.</div>

        <div class="text">The “Point The Way” system is a wayfinding system made for people with dementia. The aim of it is to help people with dementia in a care home gain some independence by implementing a railing which constantly reminds them which way they are headed, so simple tasks such as going to the kitchen for a snack or going to the toilet can be made really easy.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="col2">
        <div class="text">The railing system is colour coded as well as texturised to that it can be as distinguishable as possible for the user and helps point the way. Through sketch work, and physical modelling we conceptualised the system. Later taking to Google SketchUp I quickly visualised it in three dimensional digital space.</div>
