        I COMPLETED THIS BRIEF AS ONE OF THE ENTRIES FOR THE D&AD NEW BLOOD AWARDS 2018. I CHOSE THIS BRIEF BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVATION INVOLVED AND FOCUS A LOT AROUND MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND HOW YOU WOULD USE THAT TO HELP A COMPANY EXPAND AND GROW REVENUE.

        <div class="text">“Bacardi brings people together as their truest selves, letting them shed the pressures of society and act from instinct.”</div>
        <div class="text">Bacardi tie in most of their activation to music and events such as festivals during the summer where you have young adults being free having a good time. How could Bacardi become more of a year round drink?</div>
        <div class="text">The aim is to bring more attention to the brand in new and exciting campaigns whilst maintaining the Bacardi look and feel, that 150 years of heritage lives on.</div>

        <div class="text">How could one encourage people to start conversations with each other, in a world led by social media. How do you get people to be more physical, and in person, to go do activities away from your phone with real people.</div>
        <div class="text">With social media having taken over our social lives the best opportunities for good marketing are all online, that is where it will be seen that is where someone will engage with it.</div>

        <div class="text">Music is the number one shared experience, it is that one thing that everyone can enjoy together. A person’s music taste can say a lot about them, and when it comes to first impressions you would not want to give a wrong one. Through a simple hyper-link to Spotify we could have people connecting on whole new levels when coming to meet that special someone.</div>
        <div class="text">Today all you have to do is swipe right and you may have found the one, but this process can be long and daunting so how could we encourage sociability and get people to start conversations with each other? Through interaction. By putting a green button right onto someone’s profile, within seconds you could be listening to their favourite track, enjoy a piece of their personality, that is what Bacardi want to capture.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="col2">
        <div class="text">That is why the customisable portrait frames provide a great setting for the type of person you are connecting with. For example the way that you can choose the colour of your frame to be the same as the album cover of your favourite song, it shows you are passionate about what you believe in and shows dedication and determination, some good traits. The guy in the top-left seems like a man who enjoys a rather luxurious lifestyle with the way he used the Bacardi bat pattern as a background rather than a frame, and the guy in the bottom-right has some true dedication to Kanye West by having the same colour frame as the album cover.</div>
