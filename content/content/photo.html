        <div>HERE IS A COLLECTION OF LOGO DESIGNS I HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. SOME WERE REAL BRIEFS FOR REAL CLIENTS, SOME WERE MADE UP BRIEFS. EACH TIME I AM EXPERIMENTING WITH A DIFFERENT ELEMENT OF DESIGN, BE IT NEGATIVE SPACE, FIBONACCI’S GOLDEN RATIO, LINE ART, POP ART, ABSTRACT ETC.</div>

      <div class="text">Everyone knows how important it is to layout your findings and insights, no matter how much you have done, unless you present it in a clear logical way, someone reading your work could get confused if the way that it is presented does not reflect clearly what your findings are.</div>

      <div class="text">Here I have my research boards for the D&AD New Blood Awards 2018 Bacardi brief. Over the space of two days I delved deep into researching the brand identity, the target audience and did a lot of idea generation before developing a finalised outcome. The photograph is very off colour due to the dull and low lighting in my room. Also a tutor would not be able to decipher this if I was to present it in a book. It must be shown in pieces.</div>

    <div class="col2">
      <div class="text">I took that first photograph and chopped it up into sections. Through cutting out methods such as the “Quick Selection Tool”, “Color Range” and the “Eraser Tool”, I managed to get a pretty close look and feel of the paper being stuck right there on the screen. With the “Eraser Tool” on 30% I went over each masking tape. What this allowed me to do is have any colour background or texture and the research will still blend in to clean flat image, because the masking tape is translucent.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="col2">
      <div class="text">Through various adjustment layers such as “Levels”, “Curves”, “Hue/ Saturation” etc, I corrected the colouring as much as the photograph allowed, where the paper is still yellow and colours are very off, it is nevertheless much easier on the eyes it not being so yellow. Also the bronze background colour works very nicely with the tone of the images.</div>

      <div class="text">There are other examples of me implementing this method to presenting research, I feel it is a very clear and understandable way to lay out findings.</div>

    <div class="col2">
      <div class="text">The secret about this project is it took all day to do, to get the perspective right, the letters to all be the same size it was tedious and the shapes we were working with made it very hard to do it right. As a matter of fact it took so long that we lost the daylight and we ran out of tape at the end. This left the project incomplete. However that did not stop me from completing the piece using other means.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="col2">
      <div class="text">Can you guess which letters were not done by tape but rather photoshopped on? The “COM” in “COMMUNITY”. Keeping in mind perspective, the relation between floor and wall, texture and depth, I used my Adobe knowledge to complete this project.</div>

      <div class="text">Here is a close up on all the letters which I completely photoshopped in. Notice the tape stretching and bending around the wheel of the bin, or the fencing giving the tape depth and texture as it runs down the ridges.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="col2">
      <div class="text">I also made general touch ups on the photo to get rid of any major imperfections so when you look at the lettering it is as correct as it can be given the circumstances.</div>

      <div class="text">This is one of the first full photoshopped pieces I ever did. When I first started out with my Wacom graphics tablet, I really got into photo manipulation, where these photographs are not the highest resolution you can still see how I am piecing together this photograph.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="col2">
      <div class="text">Notice the front of the nearest ship is broken off and on fire, but you can also see the reflection in the water. Little details that bring the photograph together that much more, or in the background the church tower is mid impact with a meteor and the top of it is falling down. Was really nostalgic stumbling across this piece.</div>
