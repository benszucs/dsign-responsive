        I COMPLETED THIS BRIEF AS ONE OF THE ENTRIES FOR THE RSA STUDENT DESIGN AWARDS 2018. FOR THIS BRIEF I WAS REQUIRED TO TACKLE A MODERN ISSUE WHICH IS MORE GENERATIONS LIVING UNDER ONE ROOF. I WAS TO DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE A MODEL OF MY CONCEPT, WHICH I DID USING ACRYLIC PLASTIC CUT ON A LASER CUTTER.

      <div class="text-box">Democratic trends and property prices being on the rise means that more and more families are encouraged to live together, and increasingly multiple generations in the same house. The kitchen is a social space where the family share moments and emotional experiences. With modern technologies brings the opportunity for creative design to re-imagine how we use the kitchen as a family.</div>
      <div class="text-box">With DS Kitchens you are able to re-arrange, rotate, re-order and simply transform your kitchen whenever you want. With three units magnetically snapping together you are able to make a standard height counter top of 90cm tall.  From young to old, whether able bodied or disabled, there are many different layouts you can experiment with to make your kitchen ideal for any size family.</div>
      <div class="text-box">The kitchen can pack down to be quite a space preserving unit so it can be really suitable for those with a smaller room as a kitchen. However those with larger kitchen space can explore the possibilities much further. Thanks to the magnets at each corner of every unit, not only does it snap together with ease, but you can stack them in a large number of variations.</div>

        <div class="text-box">With the ideal height of 90cm, three units make for an optimal stack, however that does not stop the user from reaching new heights. <br>A flip out table, capped to the height of 60cm makes for a great second work surface for someone in a wheelchair who might want to get involved with whatâ€™s happening in the kitchen.</div>
        <div class="text-box">With modern technologies such as the induction hob, the stove can be just as mobile as the rest of the kitchen. With it only needing a connection to a power outlet to work, this layout could be transformed to suit a disabled person.<br>Maximised space use allows for a lot of storage space from just a couple of drawers.</div>
        <div class="text-box">With the help of physics, the magnets not only allow for a quick seamless assembly but also stops the user from ever assembling it the wrong way.<br>There are no limits in how this kitchen can be arranged, from a very small compact kitchen, the same amount of units can transform into some rather aesthetic and minimalist layouts.</div>
