        <div class="text">The Community Camera was a social experiment aimed at bringing the community together without making them get together and attend a social event. The film camera cased inside a shell, so it cannot be removed, sits on a stand and people come up and pose behind the frame while a friend takes a photo, and that is all there is to it. The results and feedback we got from this experiment was beyond what we expected.</div>

      <div class="text">The set up involved a camera stand with a camera secured in with screws, a frame for people to stand behind, a sign hanging to grab peoples’ attention, some clear instructions on how to use the camera as well as a log book so we can see how well people interact with it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="col2">
      <div class="text">We had over two reels of film filled with peoples’ photographs from two different locations which we hung on a plaque and hanged it from the frame for the community to see. We had pictures ranging between all ages, children, young adults, families and elderly people, everyone in the neighbourhood was getting involved with the Community Camera.</div>

      <div class="text">“Clean up your community” was a social interaction which we set up, it is a set of three bins that has a message going across it which you could only read from one angle. This was set up in a way that anyone passing by would be in perspective at some point so they can read it. Anyone walking past it that noticed it would have been intrigued in what the message had to say, and hopefully they listened.</div>

      <div class="text">We analysed Poole high street and its social situation. We found that a lot of the civilians there were elderly or disabled, and the shops and buildings were either broken down or abandoned completely, generally not creating a great atmosphere. We looked for the cause of this negative atmosphere and looked for a solution for this issue.</div>

    <div class="col2">
      <div class="text">We found the courtyard was filled with large walls that had lamps coming out of them, people used this as an area to sit, however the level was too high creating a really uncomfortable experience for the user. So through conceptualisation and 3D modelling I transformed the courtyard into a social space where people can all sit down and relax.</div>
